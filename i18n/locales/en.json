  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Is temporary email secure?",
      "answer": "Yes, our temporary email service is very secure. We do not store your personal information, and all email content is securely processed to remove potentially malicious code. However, please note that temporary email is not suitable for receiving sensitive or important information, as anyone who knows the email address can view the emails."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How long are emails stored?",
      "answer": "Emails in the temporary inbox are generally stored for 24 hours and are automatically deleted afterward. If you need to save important information, please copy or save the email content manually before it expires."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can I send emails?",
      "answer": "Currently, our service only supports receiving emails and does not support sending emails. Temporary email is primarily used for receiving verification codes, registration confirmations, and other one-time emails."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How long does it take to receive emails?",
      "answer": "Most emails are received within a few seconds to a few minutes. If you are waiting for an important email, we recommend using the \"Check New Emails\" button or enabling the auto-check feature, which checks for new emails every 5 seconds."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Why do some websites not accept temporary emails?",
      "answer": "Some websites and services block temporary email domains to prevent spam registrations or abuse. This is a normal security measure, especially for important platforms like financial or social media sites. For these services, we recommend using your real email address for registration."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Are there any limitations to using temporary email?",
      "answer": "There are no limits on the number of times you can use our temporary email service; you can generate multiple email addresses. However, please use the service reasonably and avoid abusing it for sending spam or engaging in illegal activities. We reserve the right to restrict service for abusive behavior."
